I THINK THESE SHOULD BE UTILITIES:

decimal to binary - done
binary to decimal - done

hex to binary - done
binary to hex - done

bas64 encoding - done
base64 decoding - done

decimal to octal - done
octal to decimal - done

Should move these from networking to utilities:
dec to hex
hex to dec 



OTHER IDEAS AS UTILITIES:

Check if a number is prime
Check if a number is odd or even
square root calculator
gcd calculator
lcm calculator
factorial
fibonacci
square a number
cube a number 
product of digits (so 123 would be 1*2*3=6)
sum of digits (so 123 would be 1+2+3=6)
number reversal
maximum digit number (so 123 would be 3)
minimum digit number (so 123 would be 1)
eulers totient function



NETWORKING UTILITIES:

validate IP address would be called "is ipv4" (uses regex)

generate IP address 

generate mac address 

mac address to hex
hex to mac address





for talking to olivia - 
But I'm a smidge concerned about doing my ideas because is there anyone actually in core/expansion? Or mentors? As it is, my PRs to core are still open.
also discuss function ideas
