I THINK THESE SHOULD BE UTILITIES:

decimal to binary - done
binary to decimal - done

hex to binary - done
binary to hex - done

bas64 encoding - done
base64 decoding - doing

decimal to octal - done
octal to decimal - done

Should move these from networking to utilities:
dec to hex
hex to dec 


OTHER IDEAS AS UTILITIES:

Check if a number is prime
Check if a number is odd or even
square root calculator
gcd calculator
lcm calculator
square a number
cube a number 
product of digits (so 123 would be 1*2*3=6)
sum of digits (so 123 would be 1+2+3=6)
number reversal
maximum digit number (so 123 would be 3)
minimum digit number (so 123 would be 1)
eulers totient function
        factorial
        fibonacci
